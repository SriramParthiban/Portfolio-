<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Sriram Parthiban — an automation specialist and upcoming full-stack web developer. I’m passionate about leveraging low-code and AI-powered solutions to simplify complex workflows and help businesses scale faster. Currently, I build automation systems using tools like n8n, GHL, Zapier, and AI agents, and I’m expanding my skill set into full-fledged web development.</p>

<p>I believe technology isn’t just about code — it’s about solving real problems. With hands-on experience in automation, machine learning projects, and digital systems, I enjoy transforming manual processes into smart, efficient, and scalable solutions. Whether it's integrating multiple platforms or building end-to-end automation systems, I love working at the intersection of AI and business operations.</p>

<p>Alongside professional growth, I'm currently building my personal portfolio and deepening my web development skills — aiming to blend automation, AI, and modern web tech into meaningful products. My long-term vision is to build innovative tools and automation-driven products that empower individuals and businesses to operate smarter and unlock new levels of productivity.</p>
